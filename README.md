HOW TO USE THE PROJECT

Three product widgets are available to select. User is able to customize widgets: select color, state (active/inactive), and link it to Profile.

Only one widget can be active at a time. In case Active badge toggle is turned On on one widget, toggle of other widgets automatically turns Off.

User can check the list of active widgets in his Public profile. To open a Public profile, hover the mouse over the Information icon in the widget next to the “Link to Public Profile” text. Click the “View Public Profile” link in the tooltip.

On the Public profile page, only widgets with the selected “Link to Public Profile” checkbox will be shown.

On the Public profile page, the widget component has the same design but all interactive elements except checkbox are disabled (color select,  active badge toggle, tooltip for Link to public profile). In case the user unchecks the checkbox, the widget will be removed from the Public profile page.

“Back to product widgets” button leads to the Product widgets page.

Project has responsive design: adaptive for Mobile displays.
